Special thanks to Spoopy and CxRedix, for their visual
designs of the cosmetic Hardmod completion rewards!

Special thanks to GDLiZy, princeoflight612, realloh and
others in the Noita community for their extensive playtesting
and honest feedback throughout the development process!

Special thanks to YOU, for voluntarily suffering through the
twists and turns of our (ever so slightly evil) collab project!
